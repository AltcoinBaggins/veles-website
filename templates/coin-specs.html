                                                <p>Dynamic block rewards are calculated individually on the basis of each algorithmâ€™s hashrate. Eg. if the X11 algorithm is at 200 GH/s while Scrypt is at 5 MH/s, the rewards in the X11 blocks will be ca. 0.2 VLS, while Scrypt will be rewarding miners with ca. 0.003 VLS per block. It is therefore impossible to favour a single algorithm compared to other less used ones. Multi-algorithmic mining gives a large number of miners the opportunity to mine, which in our opinion improves the network decentralization and reward distribution. This allows both GPU and ASIC miners to join the Veles network in a harmony. The reward distribution per algorithm is consistent across the entire network, eg. if X11 accumulated a hashrate of 200 GH/s, the rewards will be comparable to Lyra2z at 30 MH/s. To successfully do a 51% attack, an attacker would have to control 51% of hashrate on each algorithm.</p>

We have included new RPC command to get the information on the current and past halving periods, current maximum block reward, number of halvings occured, the current halving interval, etc...</p>

                And If the halving doesn't occur, it will be delayed another 4000 blocks. But the dynamic block rewards will actually increase (instead of being halved), so that we'll reach our target (of coins to be mined till next halving) sooner and won't be delaying the halving unnecessarily for too long, even when the hashrate is lower than ideal. More specific info on this sort of "boost" of dynamic block rewards can be seen in next example.
                ... the output then contains info on all the 5 "halving epochs" (what I mean by "halving epoch" I'll also clarify later on if it's not clear yet), I'll post just the data since block 50k when  VCIP01 has been activated and the proper PoW rewards kicked in.</a></p>

                                                <p><a> Here we can see, for example, that at the block 52k halving has not occurred because there were only 51% of the target amount of VLS mined, from required 80%. The maximum block reward was 80 VLS.</a></p>
                                                <p><a> So the halving was delayed by another 2k blocks and this constitutes another halving epoch (APLHA_H0_E1), where the max_block_reward remains 80 VLS, but the dynamic_rewards_boost kicks in and increases dynamic blocks rewards by 50% (but always within the range of maximum block reward of 80 VLS).
                Thanks to this mechanism we can see that at the and of this epoch the initial target was actually fulfilled by 125% (as the time has increased too, those extra %  are just fine)</a></p>
                                                <p><a> As the target was met, the third section shows that the block rewards were successfully halved at the block 54k to 40 VLS and dynamic_rewards_boost turned off, next check and readjustments will happen with the start of another epoch at the block 58k.
                ...  and as I promised, to clarify on the term halving epochs, the manual page starts like this:</a></p>
