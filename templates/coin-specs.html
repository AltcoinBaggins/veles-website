                And If the halving doesn't occur, it will be delayed another 4000 blocks. But the dynamic block rewards will actually increase (instead of being halved), so that we'll reach our target (of coins to be mined till next halving) sooner and won't be delaying the halving unnecessarily for too long, even when the hashrate is lower than ideal. More specific info on this sort of "boost" of dynamic block rewards can be seen in next example.
                ... the output then contains info on all the 5 "halving epochs" (what I mean by "halving epoch" I'll also clarify later on if it's not clear yet), I'll post just the data since block 50k when  VCIP01 has been activated and the proper PoW rewards kicked in.</a></p>

                Thanks to this mechanism we can see that at the and of this epoch the initial target was actually fulfilled by 125% (as the time has increased too, those extra %  are just fine)</a></p>
