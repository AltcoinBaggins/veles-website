                                        <li><a> It starts with the most basic information, this one here says, that the next block reward halving is supposed to occur in 1579 blocks from now, but most likely it won't occur, as we've mined only 14% from required 80% of maximum theoretical block reward since the last halving (because of the dynamic block reward that depends on the hashrate - number of workers).
    And If the halving doesn't occur, it will be delayed another 4000 blocks. But the dynamic block rewards will actually increase (instead of being halved), so that we'll reach our target (of coins to be mined till next halving) sooner and won't be delaying the halving unnecessarily for too long, even when the hashrate is lower than ideal. More specific info on this sort of "boost" of dynamic block rewards can be seen in next example.
    ... the output then contains info on all the 5 "halving epochs" (what I mean by "halving epoch" I'll also clarify later on if it's not clear yet), I'll post just the data since block 50k when  VCIP01 has been activated and the proper PoW rewards kicked in.</a></li>

                                    <li><a> So the halving was delayed by another 2k blocks and this constitutes another halving epoch (APLHA_H0_E1), where the <b>max_block_reward</b> remains 80 VLS, but the <b>dynamic_rewards_boost</b> kicks in and increases dynamic blocks rewards by 50% (but always within the range of maximum block reward of 80 VLS).
    Thanks to this mechanism we can see that at the and of this epoch the initial target was actually fulfilled by 125% (as the time has increased too, those extra %  are just fine)</a></li>
                                    <li><a> As the target was met, the third section shows that the block rewards were successfully halved at the block 54k to 40 VLS and <b>dynamic_rewards_boost</b> turned off, next check and readjustments will happen with the start of another epoch at the block 58k.

                                        <li><a> It starts with the most basic information, this one here says, that the next block reward halving is supposed to occur in 1579 blocks from now, but most likely it won't occur, as we've mined only 14% from required 80% of maximum theoretical block reward since the last halving (because of the dynamic block reward that depends on the hashrate - number of workers).
    And If the halving doesn't occur, it will be delayed another 4000 blocks. But the dynamic block rewards will actually increase (instead of being halved), so that we'll reach our target (of coins to be mined till next halving) sooner and won't be delaying the halving unnecessarily for too long, even when the hashrate is lower than ideal. More specific info on this sort of "boost" of dynamic block rewards can be seen in next example.
    ... the output then contains info on all the 5 "halving epochs" (what I mean by "halving epoch" I'll also clarify later on if it's not clear yet), I'll post just the data since block 50k when  VCIP01 has been activated and the proper PoW rewards kicked in.</a></li>

                                    <li><a> So the halving was delayed by another 2k blocks and this constitutes another halving epoch (APLHA_H0_E1), where the <b>max_block_reward</b> remains 80 VLS, but the <b>dynamic_rewards_boost</b> kicks in and increases dynamic blocks rewards by 50% (but always within the range of maximum block reward of 80 VLS).
    Thanks to this mechanism we can see that at the and of this epoch the initial target was actually fulfilled by 125% (as the time has increased too, those extra %  are just fine)</a></li>
                                    <li><a> As the target was met, the third section shows that the block rewards were successfully halved at the block 54k to 40 VLS and <b>dynamic_rewards_boost</b> turned off, next check and readjustments will happen with the start of another epoch at the block 58k.
